# 🚗 Safe Driving Project using Artificial Intelligence

# 📖 Overview
This project aims to enhance road safety using artificial intelligence to detect driver eye closure and alert them when they feel drowsy. 
The project relies on OpenCV and MediaPipe for facial analysis and eye tracking, with pygame used to trigger the alert sound.

# 🚀 Key Features
✅ Automatic eye closure detection
✅ Alerts the driver with a drowsy alarm
✅ Uses artificial intelligence techniques to analyze the face and eyes
✅ Improved performance using multiprocessing
✅ Easy graphical interface using Tkinter

# 🛠 Technologies used
Programming Language: Python

Image Analysis Library: OpenCV

Face and Eye Tracking System: MediaPipe

Audio Alert: pygame

User Interface: Tkinter

# 📥 Install and run
1 - git clone https://github.com/safe-driving-project-using-artificial-intelligence.git

2 - cd safe-driving-project-using-artificial-intelligence

3 - pip install -r requirements.txt

4 - python main.py

# 📝 How to use 

1 - Launch the app and allow the camera to operate.

2 - The algorithm will monitor the driver's eyes in real time.

3 - If prolonged eye closure is detected, an alert will be triggered.

4 - The sensitivity of drowsiness detection can be adjusted through the settings.
